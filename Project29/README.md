# Exploding Monkeys

A game that puts two players against each other, both standing on high-rise buildings, and both throwing exploding bananas at each other.

## Main Topics Covered

- Destructible terrain
- Connect UIKit and SpriteKit
- Transition between scenes
- Texture atlases
- Core Graphics

## Challenges
- [x] Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
- [x] Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.
- [x] Use the physics world's gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
