# Grand Central Dispatch

A technique project that solves the problem in [project 7](../Project7) of the UI being locked up until all data is transferred.

## Main Topics Covered

- `DispatchQueue`
- `performSelector()`

## Challenges
- [x] Modify [project 1](../Project1) so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call `reloadData()` on the table view once loading has finished.
- [x] Modify [project 8](../Project8) so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Make sure to update the UI on the main thread.
- [x] Modify [project 9](../Project9) so that the filtering code takes place in the background.
