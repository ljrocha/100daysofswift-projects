# Instafilter

An app that lets users apply Core Image filters to pictures from their photo library and save those images back to their photo library.

## Main Topics Covered

- Core Image
- `CIContext`
- `CIFilter`
- `UISlider`
- `UIImagePickerController`
- `UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum()`

## Challenges
- [x] Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
- [x] Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
- [x] Experiment with having more than one slider to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
