# Auto Layout

A technique project covering Auto Layout. Part B covers adding Auto Layout constraints in code.

## Main Topics Covered

- VFL (Visual Format Language)
- Layout Anchors

## Challenges
- [x] Try replacing the `widthAnchor` of the labels with `leadingAnchor` and `trailingAnchor` constraints, which more explicitly pin the label to the edges of its parent.
- [x] Once you've completed the first challenge, try using the `safeAreaLayoutGuide` for those constraints. As a result, the labels won't go under the safe area.
- [x] Try making the height of the labels equal to 1/5th of the main view, minus 10 for the spacing.
