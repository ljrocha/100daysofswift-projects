# Milestone Challenge: Projects 22-24

Implement three Swift language extensions:
- [x] Extend `UIView` so that it has a `bounceOut(duration:)` method that uses animation to scale its size down to 0.0001 over a specified number of seconds.
- [x] Extend `Int` with a `times()` method that runs a closure as many times as the number is high.
- [x] Extend `Array` so that it has a mutating `remove(item:)` method. If the item exists more than once, it should remove only the first instance it finds.
