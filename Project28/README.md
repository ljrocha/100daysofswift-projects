# Secret Swift

A secure text editor. Users can type anything they want and have it saved, but to read it again they must unlock the app using Touch ID or Face ID.

## Main Topics Covered

- iOS Keychain
- Local Authentication
- Touch ID
- Face ID

## Challenges
- [x] Add a Done button as a navigation bar item that causes the app to re-lock immediately rather than waiting for the user to quit. This should only be shown when the app is unlocked.
- [x] Create a password system for your app so that the TouchID/FaceID fallback is more useful.
- [x] Go back to [project 10](../Project10)(Names to Faces) and add biometric authentication so the user's pictures are shown only when they have unlocked the app.
