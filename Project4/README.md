# Easy Browser

A simple web browser app with restrictions to where the users can navigate.

## Main Topics Covered

- WKWebView
- UIToolbar
- UIProgressView
- Delegation
- KVO (Key-value observing)
- Creating views programmatically

## Challenges
- [x] If users try to visit a URL that isn't allowed, show an alert saying it's blocked.
- [x] Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. They should use the `webView.goBack` and `webView.goForward` methods.
- [x] Try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in [project 1](../Project1), where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.
