# Pachinko

A `SpriteKit` game similar to Pachinko.

## Main Topics Covered

- `SKSpriteNode`
- `SKPhysicsBody`
- `SKPhysicsContactDelegate`
- `SKAction`
- `SKLabelNode`
- `SKEmitterNode`
- `UITouch`

## Challenges
- [x] The pictures we are using have other ball pictures rather than just "ballRed". Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
- [x] Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are created near the top of the screen.
- [x] Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
