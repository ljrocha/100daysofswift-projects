# Marble Maze

A rolling ball game that uses the accelerometer to roll the ball while avoiding holes.

## Main Topics Covered

- Core Motion
- `CMMotionManager`
- Loading a game level from a file
- Physics bit masks
- `SKPhysicsContactDelegate`

## Challenges
- [x] Rewrite the `loadLevel()` method so that it's made up of multiple smaller methods.
- [x] When the player finally makes it to the finish marker, nothing happens. What should happen? You could easily design several new levels and have them progress through.
- [x] Add a new block type, such as a teleport that moves the player from one teleport point to the other.
