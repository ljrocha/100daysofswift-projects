# User Defaults

A technique project on `UserDefaults`. [Part A](../Project12a) demonstrates `NSCoding`. [Part B](../Project12b) demonstrates `Codable`.

## Main Topics Covered

- `UserDefaults`
- `NSCoding`
- `NSKeyedArchiver`
- `NSKeyedUnarchiver`
- `Codable`
- `JSONEncoder`
- `JSONDecoder`

## Challenges
- [x] Modify [project 1](../Project1) so that it remembers how many times each storm image was shown - optionally, show the view count as a subtitle below each image name in the table view.
- [x] Modify [project 2](../Project2) so that it saves the player's highest score and shows a special message if their new score beat the previous high score.
- [x] Modify [project 5](../Project5) so that it saves the current word and all the player's entries to `UserDefaults`, then loads them back when the app launches.
